    â‹®

Define a new differentiation rule for the function `M.f` and the given arguments, which should
be treated as bindings to Julia expressions.

The LHS should be a function call with a non-splatted argument list, and the RHS should be
the derivative expression, or in the `n`-ary case, an `n`-tuple of expressions where the
`i`th expression is the derivative of `f` w.r.t the `i`th argument. Arguments should be
interpolated wherever they are used on the RHS.

Note that differentiation rules are purely symbolic, so no type annotations should be used.

Examples:

    @define_diffrule Base.cos(x)          = :(-sin(\$x))
    @define_diffrule Base.:/(x, y)        = :(inv(\$y)), :(-\$x / (\$y^2))
    @define_diffrule Base.polygamma(m, x) = :NaN,       :(polygamma(\$m + 1, \$x))

    diffrule(M::Symbol, f::Symbol, args...)

Return the derivative expression for `M.f` at the given argument(s), with the argument(s)
interpolated into the returned expression.

In the `n`-ary case, an `n`-tuple of expressions will be returned where the `i`th expression
is the derivative of `f` w.r.t the `i`th argument.

Examples:

    julia> DiffResults.diffrule(:Base, :sin, 1)
    :(cos(1))

    :(cos(x))
